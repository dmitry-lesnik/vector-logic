    """
    Finds one "predator" state vector and a list of "prey" state vectors.

    The "prey" state vectors will be multiplied by the "predator". The idea
    is that the expected size of the "prey" state vectors should shrink.

    We estimate the size of the product of two state vectors to be
    `n1 * n2 * base^m`, where `n1` and `n2` are the sizes of the operands,
    and `m` is the size of the intersection of their pivot sets.

    The relative reduction score of the second operand is:
    `score = size_before / size_after = 1 / (n1 * base^m)`
    If `score > 1`, the size of vector `n2` is expected to shrink.

    This method calculates a matrix of these scores and looks for a "predator"
    row `i` (where `n_i` is small, constrained by `max_predator_size`) that
    has high scores (e.g., > `threshold`) against multiple "prey" columns.

    The method finds the best row, in which we have more than one score
    that is bigger than 1. For every row, we calculate a row-score - the
    mean of squares of those scores that are bigger than `threshold`.

    If there is any row-score greater than 0, the method returns the
    index of the best row as a "predator" index, and a list of indices of
    those columns where the score is bigger than 1 as "prey" indices.

    Otherwise, the method returns (None, None).

    Parameters
    ----------
    sv_sizes : List[int]
        A list of the sizes (number of TObjects) of the StateVectors.
    intersection_sizes : np.ndarray
        A square matrix of pivot set intersection sizes.
    base : float, optional
        The base for the exponential reduction estimation. Defaults to 0.8.
    threshold : float, optional
        The minimum row-score to trigger the predator-prey optimization. Defaults to 1.5.
    max_predator_size: int
        The maximum size (number of TObjects) a StateVector can have to be considered a predator.
